In-Class Social Media
=====================

"Don't raise your hand! Just like!"  An in-class social medium where students can anonymously raise questions without having to interrupt the class. Questions are shown in a question box on individual computer screens and can be liked by other students, whose color changes as the number of likes increases. Java was used.
